# GitHub Workflow Plan

## Directory Structure
- `.github/`
  - `workflows/`
    - `fail-workflow.yml` (to be created in Code mode)

## Workflow File Content
The `fail-workflow.yml` file should contain:

```yaml
name: Intentionally Failing Workflow

# Trigger on push events
on: [push]

jobs:
  fail-job:
    name: This Job Will Fail
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Intentionally fail
        run: |
          echo "This step will intentionally fail"
          exit 1  # Non-zero exit code causes the step to fail
```

This workflow will:
1. Run whenever code is pushed to the repository
2. Execute a single job on an Ubuntu runner
3. Check out the repository code
4. Run a step that will explicitly fail with exit code 1
